# Ethernaut solutions and write-ups in Foundry üî®

If you are looking for the base repository to solve Ethernaut on your own, you
can find it in the `ready-to-use-scaffold-branch` branch.

_This repository uses the original version of the Ethernaut challenges. It is
not modified to the 0.8 version of Solidity._

## Additional information

You will find each writeup in the distinct folder located under
`src/levels/XX-LevelName`. Each solution is located in the appropriate folder in
the `test` directory under the same name convention as the folders above
`XX-LevelName.t.sol`.

You will also find the write-ups
[on my blog](https://wizzardhat.com/complete-series/). In some cases, they are
much more detailed than those on GitHub üßê
